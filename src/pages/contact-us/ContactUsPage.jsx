                        FitnessZone is also the first choice of the best commercial gym equipment dealers in the world. These traders make a blind bid on the gym equipment packages on our platform and the highest price is then sent to the seller (gym operator). The seller can then decide to accept or decline the offer within 90 days. When the price is accepted FitnessZone makes sure the goods are collected at a convenient time and payment is made in full. Our team will make sure you have a smooth and easy trade-in process from start to finish. We manage a superior extraction service complete with all the latest legal and insurance documentation .

                        When it comes to the payment, gym operators get the funds in two agreed payment instalment. They will get 50% before the extraction and the balance on the final day of extraction (or no later than 3 working days post extraction). FitnessZone is the global leader in managing the commercial fitness equipment buy-back process.
